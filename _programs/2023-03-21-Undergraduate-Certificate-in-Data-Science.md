A undergraduate level certicate (22 credits) to provide exposure to the three major pedagogical categories within data science: understanding of the theoretical underpinnings; computational method design, development and use; and domain-specific applications. It is expected that a student obtains specialization in one of these three areas through their choice of electives.
