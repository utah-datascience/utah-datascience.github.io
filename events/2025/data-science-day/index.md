## Keynote  

**Where is RobotGPT?** \
by [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) (NVidia & U Washington) \
2-3pm | Union Ballroom

*Abstract:* \
The last years have seen astonishing progress in the capabilities of generative AI techniques, particularly in the areas of language and visual understanding and generation. Key to the success of these models are the use of image and text data sets of unprecedented scale along with models that are able to digest such large datasets.  We are now seeing the first examples of leveraging such models to equip robots with open-world visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.  Unfortunately, however, we have not achieved the RobotGPT moment; these models still struggle with reasoning about geometry and physical interactions in the real world, resulting in brittle performance on seemingly simple tasks such as manipulating objects in the open world.  A crucial reason for this problem is the lack of data suitable to train powerful, general models for robot decision making and control.
In this talk, I will discuss approaches to generating large datasets for training robot manipulation capabilities, with a focus on the role simulation can play in this context.  I will show some of our prior work, where we demonstrated robust sim-to-real transfer of manipulation skills trained in simulation, and then discuss a promising direction toward training a model architecture that combines high-level, semantic, open-world reasoning, with low-level 3D robot policies.
