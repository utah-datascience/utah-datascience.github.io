My research sits at the intersection of causal inference (CI)—particularly for observational studies—and machine learning (ML). I focus on (1) leveraging ML to capture complex, high-dimensional confounding so that causal effect estimation is feasible in realistic settings, and (2) importing causal concepts into ML to design methods that tackle pressing Responsible AI issues.
