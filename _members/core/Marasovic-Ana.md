Her research interests broadly fall into NLP, human-centered AI, and intrepretability. The goal of her research is to develop and rigorously evaluate frontier AI models, such as large language models, to empower individuals and groups through effective AI-assisted decision-making, communication, and creativity. Her work is motivated by the idea that AI could complement people's knowledge and skills, even among specialists like Go players or biophysicists, and that explainability techniques could help extract and communicate this knowledge in a human-understandable form. With her primary research community in NLP, she have focused largely on problems with unstructured textual data while also exploring visual and, more recently, audio data.
