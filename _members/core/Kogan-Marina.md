Marina Kogan works at the intersection of data science and human-centered computing. She develops human-centered data science (HCDS) methods that in addition to their scalability account for the highly-contextual nature of social activity in online environments. As Kogan also works in the area of Crisis Informatics, context-sensitive methods are especially important to her safety-critical application domain. In 2022, she co-authored Human-Centered Data Science, an introductory textbook to for the emerging HCDS field. Kogan often employed the lens of complex adaptive systems to model and understand group behavior on online platforms. The complex systems perspective allows her to trace and model how individual behaviors “add up” to the collective social dynamics.
