His research expertise lies in building data systems that target the main data engineering pain points in data science development. His focus areas include (1) discovering datasets from data lakes using novel interfaces that make it possible for non-expert users to express their queries; (2) data debugging where users seek to identify data-centric anomalies in large-scale pipelines; and (3) data cleaning where the goal is to help users repair data errors.
