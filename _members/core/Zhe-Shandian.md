His research interests mainly lie in probabilistic machine learning. That is, using probabilistic frameworks to formulate learning problems and to infer/estimate model parameters. His research include but are not limited to probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian nonparametric, approximate inference, Bayesian deep learning, sparse learning, large-scale machine learning and kernel methods. From application side, He have developed probabilistic methods for microarray data analysis, association study for Alzheimer's disease, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis, and click-through-rate prediction for online advertising.
