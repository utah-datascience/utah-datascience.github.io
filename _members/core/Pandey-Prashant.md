His goal as a researcher is to advance the theory and practice of
resource-efficient data structures and employ them to democratize complex and
large-scale data analyses. He designs and builds tools for large-scale data
management problems across computational biology, stream processing, and
storage. His current interests include high-performance data structures for modern hardware,
peta-byte scale indexes for genomic data, and scalable representation for streaming graphs.
