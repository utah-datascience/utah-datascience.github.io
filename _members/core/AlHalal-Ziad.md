Ziad's research focuses on computer vision and AI, aiming to create adaptable and efficient systems that learn with minimal data, computational resources, and supervision. His work addresses the limitations of traditional AI by developing new methods for dynamic learning and transferable skills, enabling systems to adapt to new visual tasks and environments. Additionally, his work on multimodal learning combines various modalities, such as language and audio, with vision to improve the understanding of complex 3D scenes and enhance the robustness, interaction, and decision-making capabilities of AI systems in dynamic, real-world scenarios.
