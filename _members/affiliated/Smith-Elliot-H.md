My research focuses on representation and computation in ensembles of human brain cells. The basic motivating question is “what are the neural computations that underlie archetypically human cognitive processes and how are they altered in neurological or psychiatric disorders?” The cognitive processes I am most interested in are value-based choices, rapid flexible cognitive control, and social cognition. In order to understand these processes underlying human cognition, we record from the brains of neurosurgical patients who are undergoing monitoring in order to diagnose and treat neurological disorders such as Epilepsy and Parkinson’s Disease. In the process, we generate some of the largest datasets in neuroscience.
