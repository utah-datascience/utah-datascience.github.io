I am interested in developing novel computational tools and pipelines in the analysis of medical and genetic data. My main focus is to study human disease using bioinformatic methods to solve pressing needs in health care, such as personalized medicine. We use probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian Networks) and Machine Learning techniques to integrate clinical data with genetic data from high-throughput sequencing to generate probabilistic models to predict clinical outcomes.
