His research focuses on advancing the theory and practice of scientific and information visualization, with an emphasis on human-centered visualization design and topology-based methods for visual analysis. Recent work in human-centered design investigates how interaction, annotation, and visual encodings influence perception, interpretation, and trust in data. In addition, his research in topology develops algorithms and interactive systems to support uncertainty-aware analysis and enable scalable exploration of large datasets.
