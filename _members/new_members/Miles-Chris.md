Chris is a computational biologist and applied mathematician who develops methods to extract mechanistic insight from large-scale, noisy biological data. He bridges classical mathematical modeling with modern data-driven approaches, combining stochastic modeling, simulation-based inference, and "physics-informed" machine learning to uncover the molecular rules of cellular dynamics. Recent interests include inverse problems in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and learning stochastic dynamics from static data.
