He specializes in designing algorithms for data science.  This includes work in geometric data analysis, data mining, scaling to big data, spatial statistics,  databases, AI, and machine learning.  His recent focus has been on understanding the geometry of language models, large-scale spatial statistics, approximations in kernel methods, and developing new streaming algorithms for core tasks in data analysis.
